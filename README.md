# CS1030JavaFinal
My final program for my foundations of computing class.
This Java program takes an age value from the user
and uses that number to calculate the user's age in 
months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. The application
then displays those values back to the user.
Numbers grow very large, very quickly, and were
not formatted for the sake of simplicity.
